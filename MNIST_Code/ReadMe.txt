To run this code you just need to open the .py file and indicate the file locations of your test and training sets. 

The data has to be in two different files and tab seperated. Each line is one sample.

This code uses NumPy and time. Time is only used to output the amount of time it took for the code to run.

After changing file locations and checking if NumPy and Time are available, just use python3 to run:
python3 <filename>.py

Warning: Very slow. Takes ~0.2 seconds per sample. Takes about 3.5 hours for 30 epochs of 2000 samples
